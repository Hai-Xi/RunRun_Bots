## 4. User Story

### A Day in the Life of a User

Jane, a busy professional working in downtown San Francisco, needs to send an important document to her colleague across town. She opens the **Robot & Drone Delivery Web App** on her laptop and quickly logs in using her Google account.

1. **Placing an Order:** Jane navigates to the order placement page, enters the details of her package, and specifies her delivery requirements. She inputs the pickup and delivery addresses and selects "express delivery."  
2. **Receiving Delivery Recommendations:** The app instantly presents Jane with a list of optimized delivery options. One option is via a **ground robot**, which takes 45 minutes, while the other is via a **drone**, which takes only 20 minutes but costs slightly more. She chooses the drone delivery for speed.  
3. **Confirming & Paying:** Jane reviews the final cost and delivery time estimate, confirms her order, and securely pays using her saved payment method.  
4. **Tracking in Real-Time:** After a few minutes, Jane gets a notification that her drone is en route. She opens the tracking page and watches a **real-time map** of her package moving across the city, powered by **Google Maps API**.  
5. **Delivery Completion:** 20 minutes later, Jane receives another notification: "Your package has arrived!" She checks her doorstep and finds the document securely delivered. The app prompts her to **rate her experience** and logs the order in her **delivery history** for future reference.

This seamless process ensures Jane can quickly and efficiently send packages without hassle, enhancing her daily productivity.

## 5. API Integration Requirements

| Feature | API Endpoint | Method | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| User Authentication | `/api/auth/login` | POST | Authenticate user login |
| User Registration | `/api/auth/signup` | POST | Register a new user |
| Fetch User Profile | `/api/user/profile` | GET | Retrieve user profile details |
| Update User Profile | `/api/user/profile/update` | PUT | Modify user details |
| Create Order | `/api/orders/create` | POST | Place a new delivery order |
| Get Delivery Options | `/api/orders/recommendations` | GET | Fetch optimized delivery options |
| Confirm Order & Payment | `/api/orders/confirm` | POST | Confirm order and process payment |
| Order Tracking | `/api/orders/track/:id` | GET | Get real-time tracking info |
| Order History | `/api/orders/history` | GET | Fetch past delivery orders |
| Google Maps API (Frontend) | `Google Maps SDK` | Client-side | Display real-time tracking interface |
| Google Maps API (Backend) | `Google Directions API` | Server-side | Compute optimal delivery routes |

### *Frontend vs Backend Google Maps API Usage

* **Frontend:** Google Maps SDK will be used to display the **real-time tracking map** within the user interface, allowing users to visually see the robot/drone moving towards its destination. [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview)

* **Backend:** Google Directions API will be utilized to **compute optimized routes**, taking into account traffic conditions, drone no-fly zones, and robot-friendly paths. The backend will then return this data to the frontend for display.

## 6. Frontend Architecture

* **Frontend Framework:** React.js   
* **State Management:** Redux / React Context?  
* **Styling:** TailwindCSS?  
* **Real-time Tracking:** WebSockets / Firebase
